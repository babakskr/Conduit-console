# Step Definitions (Stubs)

This folder contains non-destructive starter stubs for common BDD runners.

- `conduit_steps.behave.py` for Python `behave`
- `conduit_steps.cucumber.rb` for Ruby `cucumber`

These are intentionally minimal and mapped to Conduit-console domain wording.
Use `tests/bdd/scripts/ab_test.sh` for immediate repo verification without extra dependencies.
